gSection 1 - Introduction

g1.1 - Purpose
This handbook is designed for everyone working within OceanCrest Entertainment—whether you're a producer, writer, actor, editor, builder, or part of any internal team. It exists to align how we operate, how we collaborate, and what’s expected from each person involved.
This is a evolving reference meant to protect creative energy, avoid miscommunication, and keep OceanCrest efficient, respectful, and forward-focused.
From short films to scripted events and long-term series, this handbook applies across all OceanCrest projects. This document is for OceanCrest productions only.
As the studio grows, so will this handbook. It’s here to help us scale without losing the things that actually work.

g1.2 - Who is this handbook for?
This handbook is for anyone working within OceanCrest Entertainment, including:
Head of Teams
Team Members
Actors
Builders
Marketers
Editors & Post-Production
New Trials


If you're on a project that carries the OceanCrest name or operates under its banner, this applies to you—whether you're leading a team or joining one for a limited-time event.
This is not for:
Volunteers unaffiliated with OceanCrest projects
External partners without clearance or oversight roles
Fans or audience members (this is not a public-facing doc)


This is an internal handbook meant to create consistency and clarity across teams. You don't need to memorize it, but you do need to follow it, and check back as it evolves.

g1.3 - How to Use
This handbook is a living guide, designed to be referenced whenever you need clarity on how OceanCrest works, what’s expected, or where to find resources.
Don’t try to read it all at once. Use it as a go-to manual when questions arise about roles, communication, conduct, or project workflows.


Check back often. As the studio evolves, this handbook will be updated. Make sure you’re always working with the latest version.


Ask questions. If something isn’t clear or you think a section needs improvement, reach out to your team lead or the studio’s point of contact.


Respect the policies. Following this guide keeps our creative environment safe, productive, and respectful for everyone.


Think of it as your personal playbook for navigating OceanCrest. It is not a rulebook (see #information in discord), but a roadmap.

OceanCrest operates with a trust-based, professional environment. Joining the team means committing to the project and the people around you. Leaving the team should be handled with the same level of respect.
Joining the Team
Recruitment is handled directly by Executives. There are no open applications or tryouts unless announced.
Trial Periods may be used for new members. During this time, behavior, communication, and reliability are observed.
Access is limited at first—new members earn deeper involvement by showing consistency and team fit.
You’re expected to read this handbook before fully integrating into any team.
Exiting the Team
If you need to step down, give notice and explain your reason when possible. You won’t be punished for leaving respectfully.
Ghosting or vanishing mid-project without communication may lead to restricted future involvement.
All project files, assets, or confidential info must remain with OceanCrest—do not take or reuse studio content.




Removal & Appeals
Removal can occur for inactivity, misconduct, or behavior that harms the team.
Serious breaches (e.g., harassment or leaks) can result in immediate removal without warning.
Appeals may be made directly to the Executive Producer. All decisions are reviewed case-by-case.


Joining OceanCrest is a creative privilege, not just a task. If you’re here, we want you to thrive—but that means being accountable too.

gSection 10 - Quotas and LOAS

g10.1 - Quotas

g10.1- Quota Info
Meeting weekly quotas is essential to maintaining consistent progress and ensuring balanced workloads across all teams. Quotas are tailored to each team’s specific needs and roles, reflecting the nature of their contributions.
Team members active in two teams are required to meet the quotas of both teams each week, balancing their time accordingly. Members involved in three or more teams need only fulfill the highest individual quota among their teams weekly, preventing burnout while sustaining productivity.
Quotas are tracked on a Sunday through Friday schedule, with Saturdays reserved for reviews, catch-ups, and rest. It’s mandatory to report quota completion to team leads by Saturday noon, allowing timely tracking and feedback. Failure to meet quotas without an approved leave or prior notice may lead to review by High Rank and potential consequences.
We emphasize communication and flexibility. Team members should notify leads promptly if they anticipate challenges meeting quotas. These measures help keep studio projects on track while supporting individual circumstances.
On the next page, you will see the quota formats for every single team. (to be sent in the respective discord forum.


g10.2 - Short LOAs
A Short LOA (Leave of Absence) refers to any planned or unplanned leave lasting 5 days or less within a quota week. These are meant for temporary breaks due to scheduling conflicts, minor illness, family matters, or personal time.
Short LOA Rules:
You must notify a High Rank or your team lead before or during the absence.
If you're gone for 5+ days, this is no longer a Short LOA—see Section 20.3.
Short LOAs excuse you from all quotas during the leave period.
If you are on multiple teams, your LOA counts across all of them, not just one.
Returning early? Awesome—but make sure to let your lead know if you're resuming work.
You don’t need to submit proof unless asked, but clear communication is expected.
Short LOAs are to support you, they are not a punishment. Use them when you need time, and keep everyone in the loop.


g10.3 - Long LOA
A Long LOA is any absence that lasts longer than 5 days within a quota week. This applies whether you're away for 6 days or several weeks. These are typically used for school breaks, vacations, health issues, or serious personal matters.
Long LOA Rules:
You must request a Long LOA from High Rank directly—not just your team lead. Please include a general reason and an estimated return date if possible.
While on Long LOA, you are exempt from all quotas and responsibilities. If you would like to not be exempt, you can instead request to have a “half-quota”.
You are still allowed (but not expected) to chat or hang out with the team if you’d like.
Once you return, let your team leads and High Rank know so you're re-added to workflow.
If you need an extension, you must request it again before the original return date passes.
Long LOAs are here to protect your time and mental health. You’re not penalized for taking one: just keep us informed, and we’ll support you however we can.

Members do not have editing permissions; only High Rank (HR) can make changes. The link to the public view of the Airtable is pinned in the Discord channel. If your information is incorrect, contact a High Rank to have it updated.

All internal tracking (excluding member quota logs) is done directly through Airtable to ensure clarity and consistency.


g11.3 - Chain of Command
OceanCrest operates under a clear chain of command to ensure organized communication, accountability, and decision-making across all teams.
Executive Producer (*EP*) - This is a HR
Producer (P) - This is a HR
Head of (Team) - This is a HR
Team MR
Team LR

If you have a question, concern, or request, follow the chain:
Team MR → Head of (Team) → HR → Executive Producer.
Skipping steps without cause may result in being ignored unless it’s an urgent or private matter.

gSection 12 - The End

g12.1 - Conclusion
This handbook exists to provide clarity, structure, and support to every member of OceanCrest. Whether you’re here as a creative lead, a builder, a writer, an actor, or anything in between: you are a vital part of what we create.
Every section, system, and standard is built not to restrict, but to guide. Our projects thrive when expectations are clear and our teams communicate well.
If something in this handbook feels confusing, missing, or outdated, let a High Rank know. Handbooks don’t lead teams, people do.
Stay organized, stay professional, and stay collaborative. We’re all in this together, and the better we work as a team, the better our stories become.
Let’s keep making something great.
